Tools and fragments that might come in handy for DIRAC admins.
kill_pilots and kill_pilots.py is work in progress
The structure models your average DIRAC command, i.e. kill_pilots belongs in the scripts directory 
and kill_pilots.py in DIRAC/WorkloadManagementSystem/scripts/kill_pilots.py
At some point this can probaly be turned into a proper DIRAC command line tool, but 
only after it was tried in anger.
